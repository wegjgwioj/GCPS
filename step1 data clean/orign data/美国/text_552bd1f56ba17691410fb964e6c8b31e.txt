原文期刊：科学美国人原文标题：We Need to Capture Carbon to Fight Climate Change本文选自2018年8月1日《科学美国人》一的篇文章。作者指出，面对气候变化的严峻挑战，政府和企业应积极利用CCUS技术，捕获、利用、储存碳，完成减碳目标。行文脉络：引出话题：应利用CCUS应对气候变化（第一、二段）——介绍CCUS的最新进展、必要性、益处（第三、四、五段）——CCUS 面临的反对及作者对此的反驳（第六段）——提出建议（第七段）。【原文】I ①The conclusion of the Paris Agreement in 2015, in which almost every nation committed to reduce their carbon emissions, was supposed to be a turning poi nt in the fight against climate change. ②But many countries have already fallen behind their goals, and the U.S. has now announced it will withdraw from the agreement. ③Meanwhile emissions worldwide continue to rise.II ①The only way to make up ground is t o aggressively pursue an approach that takes advantage of every possible strategy to reduce emissions. ②The usual suspects, such as wind and solar energy and hydropower, are part of this effort, but it must also include investing heavily in carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS)—a cohort of technologies that pull carbon dioxide from smokestacks, or even from the air, and convert it into useful materials or store it underground.III ①Although CCUS has been opposed as too expensive and unproved, recen t gains have made it far more effective. ②Improvements such as chemical compounds that are more efficient at latching onto carbon could drive the cost down from $100 per ton of captured carbon in 2016 to $20 per ton by 2025, according to a 2016 article in Science. ③Start-ups are also developing new tactics, among them the transformation of trapped carbon into fertilizer, which could spur further savings.IV ①Without CCUS, the level of cuts needed to keep global warming to two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit)—the upper limit allowed in the Paris Agreement—probably cannot be achieved, according to the International Energy Agency. ②By 2050 carbon capture and storage must provide at least 13 percent of
