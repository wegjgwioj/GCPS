2020年，德国的海上风电总发电量为26.89太瓦小时（TWh），其中北海的风电场发电量为22.76 TWh，波罗的海德国风电场的发电量为4.13 TWh。一年前，在德国海上运营的风电场产生了24.16 TWh，其中20.25 TWh来自北海，通过TenneT的传输系统。TenneT报告说，德国北海的海上风力发电量增长了12.4％。北海海上风电场的输电份额占德国总风力发电量的17.2％，到2020年达到132.32 TWh。TenneT还在北海的荷兰部分运营Borssele alpha和Borssele beta海上电网连接系统。这两个系统的总容量为1.4 GWh，在2020年将1.82 TWh的海上风能转移到了陆地上。北海正在成为西北欧洲的新动力。TenneT的首席运营官TimMeyerjürgens表示，TenneT已经在德国和荷兰运营着海上电网连接，传输容量约为8500兆瓦，其中包括德国北海的7000兆瓦。“德国政府还认识到北海对我们的电力供应极为重要，并已将2030年的目标提高到20,000兆瓦，其中TenneT将实现最大目标，约为17,000兆瓦。此外，荷兰的TenneT海上电网还将在2030年之前将输电能力提高到9600兆瓦。加在一起，到2030年将超过26000兆瓦。我们将在北海为此单独投资200亿欧元几年”，Meyerjürgens说。输电系统运营商还计划在2035年之前与财团合作伙伴在北海建立第一个跨境风力发电枢纽。该中心的发电能力为12千兆瓦，将向丹麦、荷兰和德国供应北海的电力。原文阅读：In 2020, Germany’s total offshore wind generation was 26.89 terawatt hours (TWh), of which wind farms in the North Sea generated 22.76 TWh and those in the German sector of the Baltic Sea produced 4.13 TWh of electricity.A year earlier, wind farms operating offshore Germany generated 24.16 TWh, with 20.25 TWh coming from the North Sea via TenneT’s transmission systems.TenneT has reported the 12.4 per cent increase in offshore wind generation in the German North Sea and said that, in purely mathematical terms, this meant that the annual demand of around seven million households, three quarters of a million more than in the previous year, could be covered with green energy.The share of electricity transmission from the North Sea offshore wind farms was 17.2 per cent of total wind power generation in Germany, which reached 132.32 TWh in 2020.TenneT also operates the Borssele alpha and Borssele beta offshore grid connection systems in the Dutch part of the North Sea. The two systems, with a combined capacity of 1.4 GW, transferred 1.82 TWh of offshore wind energy to land in 2020.“The North Sea is becoming the new powerhouse of Northwest Europe. TenneT already operates offshore grid connections in Germany and the Netherlands with a transmission capacity of around 8,500 megawatts, including more than 7,000 megawatts in the German North Sea”, said TenneT COO Tim Meyerjürgens.“The German government also recognises the enormous importance of the North Sea for our electricity supply and has raised the targets for 2030 to 20,000 megawatts, of which TenneT will realise the largest part with approximately 17,000 megawatts. Added to this is the TenneT offshore grid in the Netherlands, where we will increase transmission capacity to 9,600 megawatts by 2030. All together, that’s over 26,000 megawatts in 2030. We will invest 20 billion euros in the North Sea alone for this over the next few years”, Meyerjürgens said.The transmission system operator also plans to build a first cross-border wind power hub in the North Sea together with its consortium partners by 2035. The hub, which will have a capacity of 12 GW, will supply Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany with electricity generated in the North Sea.
