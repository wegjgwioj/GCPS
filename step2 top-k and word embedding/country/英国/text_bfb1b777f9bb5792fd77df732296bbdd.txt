英国首相鲍里斯·约翰逊12日在气候雄心峰会上宣布该国温室气体减排新目标，并表示英国将大力发展清洁能源，力争成为风能大国。为纪念应对气候变化《巴黎协定》达成5周年，联合国及有关国家12日以视频方式举行气候雄心峰会，约翰逊在峰会上发言。约翰逊在发言中阐述了英国政府12月初提出的该国减排温室气体的新目标，即到2030年，英国温室气体排放量与1990年相比至少减少68%。约翰逊首相说，英国已制定相关计划，推动清洁能源技术的开发和应用。约翰逊在发言中还呼吁各国共同利用科技进步“保护我们的星球”，通过创新发明保护地球避免全球变暖可能带来的灾害。Opening Remarks by Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the Climate Ambition Summit12 December 2020We are coming to the end of an extraordinary and difficult year, I think, with a sudden surge of scientific optimism.Because after barely 12 months of the pandemic, we’re seeing the vaccine going into the arms of the elderly and vulnerable, vaccines that have been product each and every one of them of vast international efforts in laboratories around the world.And so my message to you all is that, together, we can use scientific advances to protect our entire planet, our biosphere against a challenge far worse, far more destructive even than coronavirus.And by the promethean power of our invention, we can begin to defend the Earth against the disaster of global warming.And by that, I mean that, together, we can reduce our emissions, we can radically cut our dependence on fossil fuels, we can change our agricultural practices, and in short, we can reverse the process by which, for centuries, humanity has been quilting our planet in a toxic tea-cosy of greenhouse gases.And at the same, we can create hundreds of thousands of jobs, millions of jobs across the planet as we collectively recover from coronavirus.And if you doubt our ability to do that, let me tell you that when I was a child of six, this country depended on coal for 70% of our energy needs. That coal dependency is now down to 3% or less and since 1990, the UK has cut our CO2 emissions by 43% – more than any other G20 nation – and yet our economy has grown by 75%.And today, we’re putting our foot to the accelerator – in a carbon friendly way, of course – with a Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution.We want to turn the UK into the Saudi Arabia of wind power generation, enough wind power by 2030 to supply every single one of our homes with electricity.We’re going ahead with massive solar programme, even though we can’t emulate…hope to emulate the incredible things being done by India, or Australia or…or Morocco for instance. Hydro, of course – we’re liberating the awesome potential of hydrogen, whether for homes or all sorts of other uses.On electric vehicles, we’re going to ban ICEs, internal combustion engines…new internal combustion engines by…by 2030, with a very ambitious programme. We’ll continue to develop new nuclear power.We want to lengthen the lead of…of London, and the UK, as the natural home of green finance. We want our homes to be progressively emitting less and less CO2 and doing more and more retrofitting of our homes. And wherever the UK may be accused of lagging, we won’t be lagging, my friends, in lagging.We want to encourage all modes of green transport, cycling, walking and so on. We want to use the…the relatively new miracle of…of carbon capture and…and storage actually to take carbon from power generation and industrial processes and bury it in under-sea caverns created by the extraction of…of hydrocarbons.And we’re now consecrating 30% of our waters, 30% of our land surface, to nature, because we think that nature…wild nature is the best way and most effective way of retaining carbon in a natural balance.And we do all these things because they’re right for the world, they’re right for our country – but also because we know that this green industrial revolution will generate, as I say, hundreds of thousands of high-skilled, high-paid, good-quality jobs for generations to come.And we’re going to help our friends around the world by moving away from supporting drilling and mining for hydrocarbons, but putting £11.6 billion of our overseas aid to support green technology and decarbonisation across the planet.So we want to work with all of you on this…on this call, on this conference – let’s…let’s do it together. Let’s make it our collective commitment, as Antonio has just said, to get to net zero by 2050.And we in the UK, as he says, we’re going to do our bit, we’re reducing our emissions by 68% at least on 1990 levels over the next decade. And I’m really awed and humbled by the efforts of other countries around the world to set their own targets.And I just want to repeat that…that key message. We’re doing this…we’re doing this not because we are hair shirt-wearing, tree-hugging, mung bean-munching eco freaks – though I’ve got nothing against any of those categories, and mung beans are probably delicious. We’re doing it because we know that scientific advances will allow us collectively as humanity to save our planet and create millions of high-skilled jobs as we recover from COVID.So thank you all very much for joining this…this conference, this Ambition Summit, thank you to Secretary General Antonio, thank you to my co-host Emmanuel Macron, who I know shares my keen interest in protecting the ecosystems of our seas and oceans, and I look forward to seeing you all in Glasgow face-to-face next year.Thank you very much.
