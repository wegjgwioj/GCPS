美国当选总统川普会见《纽约时报》编辑部和记者，涉及风电的谈话观点以及原文实录如下：
—— “风电是大忽悠”
I mean, I have a problem with wind … just I mean, the wind is a very deceiving thing.
“我的意思是，我对风电有意见….我的意思是，风电就是个大忽悠(蒙人的事)”
——“美国不制造风机”
First of all, we don’t make the windmills in the United States. They’re made in Germany and Japan. They’re made out of massive amounts of steel, which goes into the atmosphere, whether it’s in our country or not, it goes into the atmosphere.
“首先，我们美国不制造风机，这些东西是在德国和日本生产的。生产这些机器需要大量的钢铁，(污染排放)进入了大气之中。不管是不是在美国，反正是进入了大气。”
——“风电杀鸟，不受惩罚，却还要补贴”
The windmills kill birds and the windmills need massive subsidies. In other words, we’re subsidizing wind mills all over this country. I mean, for the most part they don’t work. I don’t think they work at all without subsidy, and that bothers me, and they kill all the birds. You go to a windmill, you know in California they have the, what is it? The golden eagle? And they’re like, if you shoot a golden eagle, they go to jail for five years and yet they kill them by, they actually have to get permits that they’re only allowed to kill 30 or something in one year. The windmills are devastating to the bird population, O.K.
“风机杀鸟，而风电场需要大量的补助。换句话说，我们在全国范围内到处对风电给予补贴。我的意思是，基本上风电没有什么用，没有补贴就完全没有用。最让我闹心的是，风电杀死所有的鸟类。你们去风电场看看，你们知道加利福尼亚有那啥，金鹫。这种鸟，如果你们射杀一只金鹫的话要坐牢5年，但是风电场可以拿到许可证，一年允许杀死差不多30只。风电场对鸟类是灾难性的，就是这样。”
——“我不会再补贴风电”
With that being said, there’s a place for them. But they do need subsidy. So, if I talk negatively. I’ve been saying the same thing for years about you know, the wind industry. I wouldn’t want to subsidize it. Some environmentalists agree with me very much because of all of the things I just said, including the birds, and some don’t. But it’s hard to explain. I don’t care about anything having to do with anything having to do with anything other than the country.
“话说回来，风电也还是应该有一席之地的。但他们还是需要补贴。所以，我说起风电就会比较负面。其实你们知道，我这样评价风电工业已经很多年了。我不想再补贴风电。有些环境主义者很认同我刚才说的这些话，特别是涉及鸟类的问题，但也有些人不同意我说的话。不过很难解释清楚。不管怎样，我不会操心那些与我们国家没有关系的任何事情，任何事情。”
